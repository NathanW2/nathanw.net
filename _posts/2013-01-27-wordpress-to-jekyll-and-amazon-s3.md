Like a lot of other people I have decided to move my blog off WordPress and onto a static page based system, mainly Jekyll. I'm not going to go over all the reasons in detail, you can always [Google It](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=Wordpress+to+Jekyll) as I'm swapping for most of the same reasons that everyone else is.

In case you don't like Google, or want my spin, this is a summary of the reasons that made me switch:

{% endexcerpt %}

* Static site - Blogs are static content. I don't need any fancy PHP to generate dynamic content on the fly.

* Google Analytics - I'm a sucker for stats.  WordPress had them but I want more.

* GitHub - It's just text after all.  I can keep my site on GitHub and version it.

* I **really** hate the WordPress blog post editor - You can't tell me that you like it.  Now I just write in my posts in Vim, Sublime Text 2, or whatever, and run Jekyll-S3 to push it up. Done.

* Theme - I have always switched around my theme on WordPress because I was never really happy.  Now I can just control it how I like. (I wasn't go to pay WordPress for the ability to tweak the stylesheets) - However because I am not really good with design I'm going for a simple look.  More content less flair.

* Amazon S3 - Free Hosting! Win! (Well free for a bit then cheap as hell after that)

So that's pretty much it.  Was it worth it? I guess only time will tell.  Now just to get my search ranking back up. 

P.S As I have said I'm not great at design so if you have any feedback let me know.
