About a month ago I posted a poll asking for peoples thoughts on QGIS, considering it's been a month I figured it was time to write a summery post.  Over the weeks the poll ran it gathered a total of 149 results; So thank you everyone who took the time to fill out the form and those who retweeted by original tweet which gave my poll ever more coverage then normal.

The poll had a few limited answer questions but other then that it had three main comment boxes which people could write anything they wanted.  I did this in order to get everyones raw thoughts on what they like/don't like/want to see with QGIS.  

First some general info from the poll:

<strong>Operating System</strong>
Windows XP		75	50%
Window 7		64	43%
Mac OS/X		29	19%
Linux (any distro)	83	56%
<em>People may select more than one checkbox, so percentages may add up to more than 100%</em>

<strong>What other GIS software do you use?</strong>

ArcGIS		80	63%
MapInfo		24	19%
Other		92	73%
<em>People may select more than one checkbox, so percentages may add up to more than 100%.</em>

The following is a couple of general trends that I found repeated through out the results.
