For the past week or so I have been investigating different ways of creating a COM OLE instances of Mapinfo in C#.NET.

This post series will done in three parts over the next few days, all out lining step by step the different methods for creating an instance of a Mapinfo COM object in .NET.



	
  * Part One -> [Creating an instance using Interop.Mapinfo.dll (tied to Mapinfo version).](http://woostuff.wordpress.com/2009/04/01/com-instance-part-one/)

	
  * Part Two -> [Creating an instance using Activator.CreateInstance and reflection. (Mapinfo version independent)](http://woostuff.wordpress.com/2009/05/06/creating-a-instance-of-a-mapinfo-com-object-in-net-part-two/)

	
  * Part Three -> [Creating an instance using a mix of Activator.CreateInstance and Interop.Mapinfo.dll (Mapinfo version independent)](http://woostuff.wordpress.com/2009/06/01/creating-an-instance-of-a-mapinfo-com-object-in-net-part-three/)


NOTE:  All my examples apply to C#, I will add some VB examples a bit later.
