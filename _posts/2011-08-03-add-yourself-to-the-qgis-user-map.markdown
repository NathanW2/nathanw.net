If your a QGIS user, and you haven't done so already, how about consider adding yourself to the QGIS user map at [http://planet.qgis.org/community-map/](http://planet.qgis.org/community-map/). So far there are 604 user mapped

although Australia doesn't look like it has many users.......yet.

So if you are a QGIS user (full time or part time) it would be good to see your location on the user map esp if you are in Australia :)
