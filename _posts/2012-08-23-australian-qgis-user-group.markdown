I'm very please to announce the [Australian QGIS User Group](https://sites.google.com/site/ausqgis/home). Chris Scott ([DMS](www.mapsolutions.com.au)) and I created this group because the interest in QGIS here is growing fast and it would be nice to have a place where us Aussies can hang out and chat about QGIS stuff, discuss local issues, organize local events, <del>put shrimps on the barbie</del>.

My ultimate goal would be to turn this into a full user group much like the [Swiss QGIS User Group](http://qgis.org/en/community/swiss-user-group.html) but for now we will keep it light.

Everyone is free to view the content of the home page and the Google group, however you have to request to join the Google Group to post.  This is only so that we can keep it local and not reduce the official QGIS mailing lists.

So in saying all that. If you live in Australia. Use QGIS, or are interested in QGIS. Feel free to join the group.
