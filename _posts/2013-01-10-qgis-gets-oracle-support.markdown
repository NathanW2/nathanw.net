Seems this is a good day for QGIS Oracle users. According this [commit ](https://github.com/qgis/Quantum-GIS/commit/2fc799b98c56d988f90b67c4bbfd2c0de23b6150)made by Jürgen QGIS now has built-in Oracle support. Win!

Native Oracle support can now see QGIS being opened up to a wider user base yet again. A large user base normally means more people willing to sponsor awesome new features and bug fixes. 
 Having seen the growth in the user base from having native MS SQL Server 2008+ support I can imagine what it will be like with Oracle.


The list of formats QGIS can open and edit is getting larger and larger with each release. Is there a future for vendor lock in? I can't see it.
