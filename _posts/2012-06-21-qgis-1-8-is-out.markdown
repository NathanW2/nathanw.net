After almost a year and a lot of hard work QGIS 1.8 is finally out.  This is the best QGIS version so far, packed full of fancy new features.

The official release notice can be found here: [http://qgis.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=149](http://qgis.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=149) and downloads can be found at [http://download.qgis.org](http://download.qgis.org/)

Here is the change log of all the new stuff in 1.8:

**- QGIS Browser** -_ a stand alone app and a new panel in QGIS. The_
_browser lets you easily navigate your file system and connection based_
_(PostGIS, WFS etc.) datasets, preview them and drag and drop items_
_into the canvas._
**- DB Manager -**_ the DB manager is now officially part of QGIS core. You_
_can drag layers from the QGIS Browser into DB Manager and it will_
_import your layer into your spatial database. Drag and drop tables_
_between spatial databases and they will get imported. You can use the_
_DB Manager to execute SQL queries against your spatial database and_
_then view the spatial output for queries by adding the results to QGIS_
_as a query layer._
**- Action Tool -** _now there is a tool on the map tools toolbar that will_
_allow you to click on a vector feature and execute an action._
**- MSSQL Spatial Support -** _you can now connect to your Microsoft SQL_
_Server spatial databases using QGIS._
**- Customization -** _allows setting up simplified QGIS interface by_
_hiding various components of main window and widgets in dialogs._
**- New symbol layer types -** _Line Pattern Fill, Point Pattern fill_
**- Composers -** _have multiple lines on legend items using a specified character_
**- Expression based labelling**
**- Heatmap tool -** _a new core plugin has been added for generating_
_raster heatmaps from point data. You may need to activate this plugin_
_using the plugin manager._
**- GPS Tracking -** _The GPS live tracking user interface was overhauled_
_and many fixes and improvements were added to it._
**- Menu Re-organisation -** _The menus were re-organised a little - we now_
_have separate menus for Vector and Raster and many plugins were_
_updated to place their menus in the new Vector and Raster top level_
_menus._
**- Offset Curves -** _a new digitising tool for creating offset curves was added._
**- Terrain Analysis Plugin -** _a new core plugin was added for doing_
_terrain analysis - and it can make really good looking coloured relief_
_maps._
**- Ellipse renderer -** _symbollayer to render ellipse shapes (and also_
_rectangles, triangles, crosses by specifying width and height)._
_Moreover, the symbol layer allows to set all parameters (width,_
_height, colors, rotation, outline with) from data fields, in mm or map_
_units_
**- New scale selector with predefined scales**
**- Option to add layers to selected or active group**
**- Pan To Selected tool**
**- New tools in Vector menu -** _densify geoemtries, Build spatial index_
**- Export/add geometry column tool can export info using layer CRS,**
**project CRS or ellipsoidal measurements**
**- Model/view based tree for rules in rule-based renderer**
**- Updated CRS selector dialog**
**- Improvements in Spatial Bookmarks**
**- Plugin metadata in metadata.txt**
**- New plugin repository**
**- Refactored postgres data provider:** _support for arbitrary key_
_(including non-numeric and multi column), support for requesting a_
_certain geometry type and/or srid in QgsDataSourceURI_
_added gdal_fillnodata to GDALTools plugin_
**- Support for PostGIS TopoGeometry datatype**
**- Python bindings for vector field symbollayer and general updates to**
**the python bindings.**
**- New message log window**
**- Benchmark program**
**- Row cache for attribute table**
**- Legend independent drawing order**
