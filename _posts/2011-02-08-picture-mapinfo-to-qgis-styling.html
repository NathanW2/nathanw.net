Just a quick one.

This afternoon I was having a go at getting our work MapInfo layers to look the same in QGIS as they do in MapInfo.  I wanted to do this; 1) So I can print maps from both systems for people and they are a consistent style 2) Would rather use QGIS for every day map work.  3) To see what they compare like.    I think it came out pretty good, apart from few symbols that I didn't get time to finish.

<p style="text-align:left;"><em>Note that MapInfo has anti-aliasing and transparency  turned off, as it makes MapInfo very slow.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong><em>EDIT: To be fair here is both with the best settings turned on.  They are pretty much the same, which is a good thing.</em></strong></p>
