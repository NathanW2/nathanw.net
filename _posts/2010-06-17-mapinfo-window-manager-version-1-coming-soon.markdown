Since the release of version 0.5 of my MapInfo Window Manager I have been working on the new version which will be Version 1.0 and to be released soon.  It has some new features, bug fixes and a improved UI.


## Some Screenshots and feature run down:




### **Windows Tab**: _(Shows Open Windows)_

**Features:**



	
  * Double click to bring window to the front.

	
  * F2 turns on rename function for the selected window.

	
  * Supports all windows types, even info and stat windows. (Version 0.5 just supported Maps and Layouts)

	
  * Groups can be sorted alphabetically in ascending or descending order.  (A and D buttons)

	
  * Groups can be sorted individually.

	
  * All windows can be cloned except for Special windows.

	
  * Shows count of windows open in each group.

	
  * Windows can be locked to stop accidental closing.

	
  * Fancy icons :)




### **Closed Windows Tab: **_(shows closed windows allows them to be reopened)_


_Credit to Peter Horsboll Moller of PBBI MapInfo for this idea, which came from his MapBasic Window Helper tool._

**Features:**



	
  * Records all windows as they are closed, letting you restore the window later. (Handy for accidentally closing a legend window)

	
  * Double click to reopen window.


**Settings tab: **_(Pretty boring just lets you change some settings)_

**Features:**



	
  * Allows the program to be auto loaded and the tool to be shown when MapInfo loads.

	
  * Allows the program to store the position of itself.


_**About Tab: **_(Pretty boring also, just some info about the app and where to contact me)__

  * It's an about page, what features can it have!? :)


I have been testing my Window Manager at home and at work, I use it almost everyday, and with some people that I know.

However I would like to get some more testing done by some other people to make sure that Version 1.0 is good and stable.  I am also still look out for anymore ideas that I could throw into Version 1.0.

If you would like to give the beta a test and do some bug hunting for me, or likewise if you have a feature you would like to see rolled into Version 1.0, please contact me on here or by email (which you can see in the about tab page screenshot above)


## Just for fun:


Here is a comparison screenshot of the old and new one:
