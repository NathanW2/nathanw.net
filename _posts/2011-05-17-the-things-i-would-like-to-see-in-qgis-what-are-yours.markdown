So if you have not already guessed from my increasing post about QGIS. I really like it as a GIS system but with all systems it comes with its shortcomings. (Nothing that can't be fixed of course)

Here is my little wishlist of a few things I would love to see in QGIS.

**Multipule map canvases. (ArcGIS, MapInfo)**

_I was thinking more like ArcGIS data frames vs something like what MapInfo has (multiple windows).  I think the multi window system can add confusion for people new to GIS, plus I hate having to window manage._

__**SQL like interface. (MapInfo)**

_This is something that I really like from MapInfo.  It adds a lot of power to the application being able to spatially join two tables that don't share a command link column and get back a new layer.  Adding this to QGIS could be a pretty big task, although a very rewarding one IMO.  _

_Now there is some credit in saying "well you can just import your data into PostGIS and use that", however that is not always a option and I think having a layer above that can query any open layer would be very very powerful._

These are just two of the main things that I would like to see, I'll update the post if I can think of anymore.

Of course being open source I can write the features myself but C++ is still a bit over my head at the moment.

I would love to see what other peoples thoughts, or mini wishlists, are.  So if you are willing, drop a comment and let me know.
