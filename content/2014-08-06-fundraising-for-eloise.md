The death of our daughter was one of the hardest things my wife and I have ever had to deal with. It's not something that I wish anyone ever have to experience and feel really sorry for those who have had to do it many times. There is something really raw about losing your own flesh and blood. It cuts deep, really really deep. There are really no words to describe the emptiness that you feel, or the feelings that follow after the event.  Even with all the pain of loosing a child there is a great Australian service that helps to capture some of the final monents.  The service is called Heartfelt and we used them for Ellie.

Heartfelt is a great free service that provides a photo session, including editing and prints (hard and digital) after, in the last and final days.  This is the quote from their site:

> Heartfelt is a volunteer organisation of professional photographers from all over Australia dedicated to giving the gift of photographic memories to families that have experienced stillbirths, premature births, or have children with serious and terminal illnesses.   
>
>Heartfelt is dedicated to providing this gift to families in a caring, compassionate manner.
>
> All services are provided free of charge

Pretty impressive stuff. The last thing you want to have to do in a time like that is shell out for photos when you have other pressing issues.

As Ellie's 1st Birthday is coming in up October Stace and I would love to raise enough money to donate a camera pack to a hospital though Heartfelt in Elly's name.  We have created a fundraiser page in her name at: [http://www.mycause.com.au/page/79669/eloises1stbirthdayheartfelt](http://www.mycause.com.au/page/79669/eloises1stbirthdayheartfelt) in order collect dontations for anyone who would like to help.

Camera packs can be donated to a hospital to allow staff at the hospital to capture photos if Heartfelt can't make it.  The bonus is that Heartfelt will still edit and print the photos.  How bloody awesome is that!  More info on the camera packs is at: [http://www.mycause.com.au/page/79669/eloises1stbirthdayheartfelt](https://www.heartfelt.org.au/Camera_Project)

We would be greatful for any donations, big or small, so we can donate a camera pack in Elly's name.

We love and miss you a lot Eloise.
