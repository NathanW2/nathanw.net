Want to show of some the cool maps you have made using QGIS 1.9/2.0?

Mathieu has now setup a new Flickr group to collect and show of cool maps that have been made using the new features in the upcoming QGIS 2.0.

The group can be found at [http://www.flickr.com/groups/qgis/pool](http://www.flickr.com/groups/qgis/poo)

Here is one I uploaded a few days ago

and a cool one from Anita

Anyone can join and submit to the group.

There are just a few rules:

No Screen shots of the application
Only output from the composer or Save Image As..
List data sources used
List any new QGIS features used e.g blending, label buffers, etc
Only post maps you are proud of or you would show your mother
A QGIS Map Boo k might be on the cards in the future so keep that in mind when uploading a map to the group.

Now go forth and make awesome maps!
