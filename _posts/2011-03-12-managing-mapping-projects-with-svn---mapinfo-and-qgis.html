Recently at work I have been working on a very large planning mapping project,  we are in the process of creating our new  planning scheme and doing this involves creating a lot of maps and a lot of MapInfo workspaces.  As this project requires a lot of revisions and possible mistakes I wondered how I was going to manage keeping track of everything.   Then I remembered good old subversion.  Subversion for those that have never heard of it, is a version control system allowing you to commit changes to a file and it will keep track of what has changed at each revision.  The normal place to use version control is in software development and keeping copies of you code however I have found it shines for a complicated mapping project.
