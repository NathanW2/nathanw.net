So that came around quick.  Seems it is November already.

Tomorrow is the FOSS4G-Au a locally organized un-conference.

**How do I register?**

If you would still like to come - which you should - you can register here (it's free!) [http://www.meetup.com/osgeo-aust-nz/events/83965312/](http://www.meetup.com/osgeo-aust-nz/events/83965312/) but you **must** RSVP on the meetup page in order to get building access and internet access.

**Where is it at? (Directions)**

The un-conference is held at [The Queensland Centre for Advanced Technologies](https://maps.google.com/maps?q=Technology+Ct,+Pinjarra+Hills+Queensland+4069,+Australia&ie=UTF8&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=1&geocode=FcDvW_4dnDsdCQ&split=0) in Brisbane. Kudos to CSIRO for allowing us to use their facilities.

**More details on un-conference?**

Jody Garnett has also done a post on the un-conference and what this kind of conference style is like.  You can find more details here: [http://how2map.blogspot.com.au/2012/11/foss4g-au-tomorrow.html ](http://how2map.blogspot.com.au/2012/11/foss4g-au-tomorrow.html)
