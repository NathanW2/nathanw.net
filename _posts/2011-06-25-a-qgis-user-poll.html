I have just whipped up a small user poll for QGIS users.  The poll is just to give me (and indirectly the team) some idea of people's opinions about QGIS and what it could do better.  The poll is only short (9 questions) and one of the main things is "What could QGIS do better?".

The poll can be found here: <a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dDA5TW96Z19aNFU1OVpzSzFyRzFybmc6MQ">https://spreadsheets.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dDA5TW96Z19aNFU1OVpzSzFyRzFybmc6MQ</a>

All the answers are anonymous so feel free to say what you like about anything.  In the end if something isn't working the way you think it should, write it down. It's not going to hurt anyone's feelings :)

If you are a partial QGIS users who mostly uses MapInfo or ESRI stuff I would also like to get your opinion.
