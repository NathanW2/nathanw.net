One trend that come up a lot in the poll I recently ran <em>(results will be out soon, just writing a summary blog post)</em> is "<strong>Needs more powerful edit tools</strong>".  And I agree.

Coming from a MapInfo background nothing much changes when you move to QGIS, MapInfo had the simple Add Point, Add Region, Add Line kind of tools and then you need to use plugins to do anything a bit more advanced (<a href="http://www.geoas.de/pages/en/mapcad-oem.php">MapCAD</a>).  QGIS has the start of a kind of MapCAD thing happening although not as complete.

<strong>Why not just let people write plugins?</strong>

However I think in order to make QGIS a more attractive package to a lot of people it needs to get some built in semi-advanced to advanced editing tools;  getting back to those poll results of "Needs more powerful edit tools".

I thought to myself "What would I like QGIS to be able to do when it came to editing?" although I came up with a small set my editing needs are only relatively small.  I then thought the best way to find out what people need is to just create a blank canvas for people to throw their ideas around on and then go from there.

<strong>Why not just create a ticket?</strong>

My idea is to get a larger idea of what people need and want rather than just one-off tickets. Although the ideas will be at the edit tool idea level it will be easier to see how they should all fit together if they are all in one place and editable by other people.  You can then start asking questions like: Do we really need that UI there?  Can we merge these tools?  How should the output be handled?

The overall goal is to have a tight, thought out, group of edit tools rather then someone creating a plugin over here for one thing and some else creating something else over there.

<strong>So how do we get this going?</strong>

Well I have created a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CTjrXWu0EJqLWcKU2ifBoQKPwXlZAkZnSzewq8zsamM/edit?hl=en_US">Google Document</a> that anyone can edit and view in order to start brainstorming ideas. The link can be found <a title="QGIS Edit Tools" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CTjrXWu0EJqLWcKU2ifBoQKPwXlZAkZnSzewq8zsamM/edit?hl=en_US">here</a>.

I have already created an example of two ideas that I would like to see.

So go ahead, throw some ideas up.  I'm interested to see where this can head.

<strong>Why use Google Docs and not the QGIS wiki?</strong>

Mainly because Google Docs makes it very easy to do frictionless editing of a document together.  No need for user names or passwords or overwriting someone else's changes (Google Docs is all real time).
