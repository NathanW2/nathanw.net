{% excerpt %}
I had a feeling this year was going to be a good one for QGIS.  The recent success of the first Australian QGIS User Group in Perth, and the most recent one in Melbourne can only reinforce this.  Both events had a great turn out of around fifty people.  

The Perth event was run as three presentations followed by a discussion session.

 - Mapping Projects with QGIS (Jeremy Taylor - City of Belmont)
{% endexcerpt %}
 - Custom Plugin Development (Shane French - Department of Environment and Conservation)
 - All the New Cool Stuff in QGIS 2.0 (Nathan Woodrow - Digital Mapping Solutions)

With a bit more time to prepare we added a workshop session to the Melbourne event:

Workshops

 - Styling and managing style libraries (Chris Scott - Digital Mapping Solutions)

 - Working with the composer (Nathan Woodrow - Digital Mapping Solutions)

 - Custom QGIS forms and Python (Nathan Woodrow - Digital Mapping Solutions)

 - General Q&A

Presentations
 
 - A GIS officers journey into the light (Barrett Higman - Alpine Shire Council)

 - QGIS in Victoria Police (Nyall Dawson - Victoria Police)

 - All the New Cool Stuff in QGIS 2.0 (Nathan Woodrow - Digital Mapping Solutions)

There was a great mix of users, even a few non users keen to check QGIS out for the first time.  I was extremely happy with how both days turned out and the feedback so far has been fantastic.  A massive thanks must go to [DMS](http://www.mapsolutions.com.au/) who sponsored both events.

I also thought I might give filming and screen recording my workshop a go. Seemed to turn out alright, for a first attempt anyway.  A few mistakes here and there but live things never go 100% :)

On a side note it was also a pleasure to be able to talk about my adventures with QGIS at the [Melbourne Open GIS](http://www.meetup.com/Melbourne-Open-GIS/events/112409922/) meetup. Big thanks to Simon for asking me to talk.
