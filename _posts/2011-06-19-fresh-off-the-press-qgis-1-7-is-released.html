Tonight Tim Sutton officially made the <a href="http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-user/2011-June/012501.html">release announcement</a> for QGIS 1.7, so I'm guess I'm free to blog about the newest version now and its cool features.

What are you still doing here? <strong>Go and get it!</strong> <a title="QGIS 1.7 Download" href="http://www.qgis.org/wiki/Download">http://www.qgis.org/wiki/Download</a>

I am, as a heavy QGIS user and a guy-who-tries-to-write-features-and-patches-for-the-code, very happy with this release. I know a lot of people have put a lot of hard work and free time into working on features and bug fixes that keep making this free GIS system even better.

Some of the more notable new features in this release are...well there are just way to many for me to list here so go and check out the official list at <a href="http://qgis.org/component/content/article/127-qgis-1-7-release.html">http://qgis.org/component/content/article/127-qgis-1-7-release.html</a>

The QGIS team has shifted their source control system to using GIT, which I am very happy about as a lot of the guys on the #qgis IRC channel will know :). The bug tracer has also been moved to<a href="http://hub.qgis.org/projects/quantum-gis">http://hub.qgis.org/projects/quantum-gis</a>.

Since the release of QGIS 1.6 there have been 1199 commits (using git to count: git log --pretty=oneline upstream/release-1_6_0..upstream/release-1_7_0 | wc -l). Not a bad effort if I may so myself.

If you are still reading this, I really hope it's because you are waiting for QGIS 1.7 to install.
