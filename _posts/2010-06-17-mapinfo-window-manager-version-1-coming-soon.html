Since the release of version 0.5 of my MapInfo Window Manager I have been working on the new version which will be Version 1.0 and to be released soon.  It has some new features, bug fixes and a improved UI.
<h2>Some Screenshots and feature run down:</h2>
<h3><strong>Windows Tab</strong>: <em>(Shows Open Windows)</em></h3>
<a href="http://woostuff.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/window1.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-327" title="Window1" src="http://woostuff.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/window1.png" alt="" width="286" height="361" /></a>

<strong>Features:</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Double click to bring window to the front.</li>
	<li>F2 turns on rename function for the selected window.</li>
	<li>Supports all windows types, even info and stat windows. (Version 0.5 just supported Maps and Layouts)</li>
	<li>Groups can be sorted alphabetically in ascending or descending order.  (A and D buttons)</li>
	<li>Groups can be sorted individually.</li>
	<li>All windows can be cloned except for Special windows.</li>
	<li>Shows count of windows open in each group.</li>
	<li>Windows can be locked to stop accidental closing.</li>
	<li>Fancy icons :)</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Closed Windows Tab: </strong><em>(shows closed windows allows them to be reopened)</em></h3>
<em>Credit to Peter Horsboll Moller of PBBI MapInfo for this idea, which came from his MapBasic Window Helper tool.</em>

<strong>Features:</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Records all windows as they are closed, letting you restore the window later. (Handy for accidentally closing a legend window)</li>
	<li>Double click to reopen window.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Settings tab: </strong><em>(Pretty boring just lets you change some settings)</em>

<em><a href="http://woostuff.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/window3.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-329" title="Window3" src="http://woostuff.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/window3.png" alt="" width="219" height="364" /></a></em>

<strong>Features:</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Allows the program to be auto loaded and the tool to be shown when MapInfo loads.</li>
	<li>Allows the program to store the position of itself.</li>
</ul>
<em><span style="font-style:normal;"><strong>About Tab: </strong><em>(Pretty boring also, just some info about the app and where to contact me)</em></span></em>

<em><span style="font-style:normal;"><em><a href="http://woostuff.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/window4.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-330" title="Window4" src="http://woostuff.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/window4.png" alt="" width="219" height="364" /></a></em></span></em>

<strong>Features:</strong>
<ul>
	<li>It's an about page, what features can it have!? :)</li>
</ul>
I have been testing my Window Manager at home and at work, I use it almost everyday, and with some people that I know.

However I would like to get some more testing done by some other people to make sure that Version 1.0 is good and stable.  I am also still look out for anymore ideas that I could throw into Version 1.0.

If you would like to give the beta a test and do some bug hunting for me, or likewise if you have a feature you would like to see rolled into Version 1.0, please contact me on here or by email (which you can see in the about tab page screenshot above)
<h2>Just for fun:</h2>
Here is a comparison screenshot of the old and new one:
