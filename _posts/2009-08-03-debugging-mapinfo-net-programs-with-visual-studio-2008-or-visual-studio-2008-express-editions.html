I was looking through some of the folders on my PC and found an article that I wrote about debugging Mapbasic and .NET programs in Visual Studio, so I thought it might be handy to post it here. 

I was going to copy and paste everything in the article into a new blog post but instead I have just uploaded the pdf to the blog so it's easy for people to download.   The article can be found at <a href='http://woostuff.files.wordpress.com/2009/08/debugging20-net20mapbasic20applications.pdf'>Debugging .NET Mapbasic Applications with Visual Studio</a>
