title: About


A QGIS developer, OSGeo advocate, and general open source lover. My name is Nathan and I'm an Aussie working as a technical consultant/QGIS Specialist for [Digital Mapping Solutions](http://www.mapsolutions.com.au/) - read my blog [Disclaimer](./disclaimer.html) though. I'm quite passionate - maybe sometimes too much - about promoting and developing open source GIS projects.
