A quick [update](http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-community-team/2013-January/002436.html) from the QGIS documentation team today on the mailing list. The QGIS 1.8 manual is now available in HTML and PDF form.

HTML manual can be found at:
[http://docs.qgis.org/html/en/docs/user_manual/index.html](http://docs.qgis.org/html/en/docs/user_manual/index.html)

PDF manual at:
[http://docs.qgis.org/pdf/QGIS-1.8-UserGuide-en.pdf](http://docs.qgis.org/pdf/QGIS-1.8-UserGuide-en.pdf)

This has been part of an ongoing effort from the documentation team since before the 1.8 release to bring our all our documentation into reStructedText rather then LaTeX. Moving to reStructedText allows quicker updates and a larger range of final output formats.

I would like to thank everyone who has been involved in this process as I know what a grueling process updating documentation can be.
