Just a quick non-technical blog post.

My wife and I would like to introduce Harrison Mark Woodrow. The newest edition to our family.

Nothing has ever come close to how nervous I was yesterday morning, not knowing if Stace would finally be induced and we would have our little man. It was a long 13 hour labour but at 11:53pm (DST) 14/02/12 in Tweed Hospital, Australia little Harrison was born with all his cuteness.

All I can say is thank science for all the handy painkillers that have been created/made/found. That [Epidural](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidural) is one handy analgesia. Seeing my wife in so much pain before the Epidural was one of the hardest things I have ever had to the deal with.  Ripping my heart out, hard.

Both Harrison and Mum are doing well.
